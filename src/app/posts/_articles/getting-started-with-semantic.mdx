Welcome to `semantic` — a clean, modern blog starter built with `Next.js` and `Static Site Generation (SSG)`. Create a content-focused blog that looks great and performs even better.

## ① Fork the Repository
Visit the <a href="https://github.com/nylon-bricks/semantic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> and fork the project to create your own version of `semantic`.

## ② Clone the Repository
Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [forked-repo-git-url]
```

That's it — your own `semantic` project is now ready to begin.

## ③ Customize

Open the project in your favorite IDE — such as `VSCode` or `WebStorm` — and start editing.

### Edit Metadata
Key files are located under `/src/constants`:
- <p><code>menu.ts</code>: Menu items for the sidebar and header</p>
- <p><code>metadata.ts</code>: Site and author information</p>
- <p><code>profile.ts</code>: Profile card details on the main page</p>

These files control how your site looks and feels — make them your own.

### Create a Post
To write a new blog post, add a folder (your post's `slug`) inside `/content/posts`, then create an `.mdx` file with the **required frontmatter**.

    <strong>(Fields marked with <code>*</code> are required)</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>title*</code>: Main title of the post
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>subtitle*</code>: Short description or subtitle
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>createdAt*</code>: Original publication date
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>modifiedAt*</code>: Last updated date
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>coverImage*</code>: Top cover image (supports relative or absolute paths)
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>category*</code>: Single category assigned to the post
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>tags</code>: One or more keywords for filtering
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>comments</code>: Enable comments via{' '}
      <a href="https://giscus.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Giscus
      </a>{' '}
      (default: <code>false</code>)
    </li>
  </ul>
</Callout>

To update the `/about` page, simply modify the `/content/pages/about.mdx` file.

## ④ Run the Project
Let's run the project and get it up and running locally.

While `semantic` uses `pnpm`, you're free to use `npm` or `yarn`. We'll use `pnpm` for this guide:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your development server should now be live at `http://localhost:1113`.

To build the static site for production, simply run:

```bash
pnpm build
```
This generates the output in the `out` directory — ready to be deployed.

In the next post, we'll cover how to deploy your blog using `GitHub Pages`, with automatic builds and no local setup required.
